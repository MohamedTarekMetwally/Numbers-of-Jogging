# JOGGING TIMES PROJECT

## The goal of the project is to trace the jogging times of each user through the distance, time and date of each jogging

We have **three** types of users in the app.
> **normal user** : can only acess his own joggings.
> **moderator** : can acess his joggings and joggings of the normal users.
> **admin**: can acess any jogging on the server.

You can choose your own type while logging in. But for now in the server the default is all the accounts are users but you can upgrade any account to moderator or admin through the rails command line.
Note: you will find the commands down below.

## Here is a sample of the GUI of the Project.
